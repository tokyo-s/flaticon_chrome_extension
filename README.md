### API Approach

The extension tries multiple methods to fetch icons:

1. **Primary**: Official/unofficial Flaticon API endpoints
2. **Fallback**: Web scraping of search results
3. **Ultimate Fallback**: Direct link to Flaticon search

### Privacy & Usage

- The extension only accesses Flaticon.com
- No data is stored or transmitted to third parties
- Respects Flaticon's terms of service
- For personal/educational use only

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Won't Load
- Make sure all files are in the same folder
- Check that manifest.json is valid JSON
- Add the required icon files

### Search Not Working
- Check your internet connection
- Try different search terms
- Use the "search on Flaticon" fallback option

### No Icons Displayed
- Flaticon may have changed their API
- The extension will fallback to opening Flaticon directly
- Clear your browser cache and try again

## Customization

### Modify Search Behavior
Edit `popup.js` to:
- Change the number of results (`MAX_RESULTS`)
- Adjust search delay (`SEARCH_DELAY`)
- Add new API endpoints

### Styling Changes

## Limitations

- Uses unofficial Flaticon APIs that may change

- Search quality depends on Flaticon's API

## Development

To enhance this extension:

1. **Add Authentication**: Support for Flaticon premium accounts

3. **Multiple Providers**: Add IconScout, Material Icons, etc.
4. **Better Parsing**: Improve icon extraction from different sources
